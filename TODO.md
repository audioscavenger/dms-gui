## BUGS:
* [x] - Translations do not update immediately after language change (requires manual refresh).
* [x] - Newly created account doesn't appear on the list immediately (requires manual refresh after a few seconds).
* [x] 1.0.3 - Fails to show accounts when QUOTA is disabled
## TODO:
* [ ] - update emailValidChars based off what dms actually accepts
* [ ] - Upload my forked container to hub.docker.com
* [ ] - Implement shields.io badge
* [ ] - Implement TOML, apparently it's a thing
* [ ] - Implement functionality for the Settings page or remove it (currently mocked).
* [ ] - Should we rely on setup script or more simply read the files off dms directly?
* [x] - Add information for future contributors (e.g., contribution guidelines).
* [x] 1.0.3 - Fix account regex when QUOTA is enabled or not
* [x] 1.0.3 - Better debug logging
* [x] 1.0.3 - Variabilize SETUP_SCRIPT
