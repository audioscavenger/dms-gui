I work on this solo, until someone finds an interest like I do. Not claiming I can get to the level of complexity `Mailu` admin UI offers, but the goal is to have some usability.

The `setup` offered by DMS is quite good tbh, and sufficient for 90% of your daily operations. But sometimes a quick glance at a modern dashboard is also beneficial.

The primary goals are:

1. [x] kick start the project: **done**, thanks to dunajdev and Claude
2. [x] refactor, fix all the bugs, document and define scope: **done/WIP**
3. [x] ability to load/save/refresh data from json files or dms commands: **done**
4. [x] add rebuild/refresh xapian index buttons in Accounts page: **done**
5. [x] add a login page
6. [ ] add DNS entries page
7. [ ] add DKIM (re)gen option somewhere, maybe Accounts? with subsection by domain?
8. [ ] Ultimate goal: add DNS push entries with custom cloudflare API or octoDNS

After (7) my life will be complete and I won't need to work on this anymore :D

## BUGS:

* [ ] - the left menu is only as high as the window on first load, when you scroll down it's blank
* [ ] - DataTable usePrevious to highlight data change on reload does not work anymore

## TODO:

The **done** list versions is in reverse order, as you want to see the most recents firt.

The TODO list rank is in order, as you naturally read from top to bottom and therefore, the most difficult ones are at the top.


### chores:

* [ ] - chore/frontend: api.js and plenty other files could also use translate for their error messages
* [ ] - chore/translation: what are all those cannot* messages? no module uses them
* [ ] - chore/frontend: move all error messages into translation
* [ ] - chore/frontend: add auth bearer token for APIs and /docs
* [ ] - chore: add more comments and beautify navigation pane with ASCII art

## DECISIONS

* [ ] - Dashboard: there is no such thing as disk usage with docker. remove? yes. replace by what?
* [ ] - docker.sock seems frowned upon, why is it? Response from @polarathene:
  > The main concern is when giving write access to that API, you allow any compromised container with access to it to become root on the host (assuming rootful), which is obviously dangerous. This is less of a concern in more established projects where it may be used selectively out of trust, but smaller community projects it's a bigger ask for someone to trust the developer (the developer doesn't have to be malicious either, but is more likely at risk of being compromised themselves).

* [ ] - docker.sock seems frowned upon, how do we do without it? Maybe with Caddy and DMS api calls?
* [ ] - docker.sock could become caddy: see https://github.com/orgs/docker-mailserver/discussions/4584
* [ ] - add fail2ban management?
* [ ] - add fail2ban status?
* [ ] - add mailbox statistics?
* [ ] - offer DKIM DMARC display etc?
* [ ] - octoDNS may lack ability to modify/update and is designed to replace entire zones. Not sure it's the right tool
* [ ] - octoDNS may be able to pull the zone before pushing it with additions, looks like a lot of work
* [ ] - do we add multiple logins and roles?
* [ ] - reindex: doveadm index requires mailbox folder name, or can do it for all with `doveadm index -A -q \*`; and where do we add this option?
* [x] - octoDNS will have its own container as discussed here https://github.com/orgs/docker-mailserver/discussions/4584
* [-] - docker rootless seems simple enough but I am afraid of other consequences: https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/
* [-] - backend: separate server status from server info
* [-] - add octoDNS https://github.com/octodns/octodns but it's python; adds 99MB extra --> possible but nope we won't do that
* [-] - gave a try to octoDNS and after 2 hours of labor, I give up. Always the same error and bad samples all over the internet, not a single example they give works at all.
* [-] - frontend: convert all the db.*.json into browser json storage? no, sqlite3
* [-] - backend: added sql for accounts; nah, why?
* [x] - frontend/pages: refactor validate*Form and load them from individual files
* [-] - PORT_NODEJS: package.json / .env / webpack etc... use hard coded 3001 - so what


## Misc

* Cannot start `better-sqlite3` with `node:slim` backend base image. Therefore, base all images on 24-alpine.
  * Error was: `Error loading shared library ld-linux-x86-64.so.2: No such file or directory (needed by /app/backend/node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node)`
  * and that was fixed by adding `RUN apk add libc6-compat` to Dockerfile but now this new error: `Error relocating /app/backend/node_modules/better-sqlite3/build/Release/better_sqlite3.node: fcntl64: symbol not found`
