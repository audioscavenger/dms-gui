# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community an inclusive experience for everyone, regardless of physical appearance or personal preferences.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open community, free of hate and communism.

We are a technical / computer science community, and identity politics have no place in the discussions or projects we participate in.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Trolling
- Ad Hominem attacks and harassment
- Spreading identity politics or woke messages
- Publishing others' PII without permission or calls for doxxing
- ANY conduct legally unlawfull in your country, online or offline

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, documentation edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement via issue. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. By "promptly" we mean "as fast as we deem".

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. A minimum of two warnings will lead to a temporary ban.

### 2. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 3. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior as defined in the list of unacceptable behaviors from our standards.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any community interactions: ban from messaging and submit code. A ban list will be maintained by the Community leaders and shared with anyone upon request.

## Definitions

- communism: aka `socialism` or `marxism`, a doctrine of social organization in which all property is owned by the 'community' and each person contributes and receives according to their needs; In practice: you will own nothing and you will be happy. Since inception, all communist governments have failed or are failing, see current status of Venezuella, Cuba, China, North Korea, or Vietnam for instance. Here are some key elements of Marxism and their consequences:
  - [x] Centralisation of all powers: leads to authoritarinism and cult of the leader
  - [x] Centralisation of credit, means of communication and means of production: you will be a slave, and economy falters
  - [x] Abolition of all right of inheritance: you will own nothing
  - [x] Confiscation of the property of everyone: you will own nothing
  - [x] Equal distribution of resources based off your needs: since you are not the one defining your own needs, you will starve eventually
  - [x] Equal distribution of resources: entitlement over merit, leading to zero incentive for progress and innovation, and economy falters
  - [x] Equal liability of all to labour: you will be a slave
  - [x] Equitable distribution of the population over the country: you will be forcefully displaced

- community: a group of people living in the same place and/or having a particular characteristic in common; NOT a synonym nor a root for the word `communism`.

- DEI: Destruction, Exclusion and Indoctrination: a system that pledges to give more to certain groups despite their lack of merit, aka `discrimination` or `racism`.

- doxxing: act of purposefully diffusing physical PII about someone without their agreement, with the intent to have others reach out and cause harm to that person.

- equity: the quality of being fair and just, especially in a way that takes account of and seeks to address existing inequalities, aka `discrimination` or `racism`. In practive, act of promoting entitlement over merit, and active discrimination against certain groups of people.

- gender: aka `grammatical gender`, applies only to words from a gendered language such as Latin, Spanish, etc. Not related to the hacks `gender identity` or `transgenderism`, invented by the CSAM hack called John Money in the 60's.

- identity politics: political or social activity by or on behalf of an ethnic, cultural, religious, sex, or other group, usually undertaken with the goal of rectifying injustices suffered by group members, aka `racism`.

- PII: Personally Identifying Information: email, full name, postal address, phone number, SSN, etc/

- racism: the act of defining biological races among the human race, rather than using the sub-group called `ethnicity`. There is only one human race and the very fact of mentioning `race` among human beings is racist by definition.

- trolling: act of arguing and gaslighing online discussions, leading to frustration and chaos. Attack vectors are unacceptable behavior and also include:
  - ad hominem attacks
  - bad faith arguments
  - interjecting out of context remarks
  - harassment
  - deflecting one's responsibility onto others
  - refusing to aknowledge proven facts as evidence

- woke: the act of engaging in identity politics.
